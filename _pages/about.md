I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), where I was advised by [Asst. Prof. Gözde Gül Şahin](https://gozdesahin.github.io/) (primary) and [Professor Erdem Yörük](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=WHMhrZcAAAAJ) (co-advisor). My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Computational Social Science**, with particular interests in bias detection, hate speech detection, and multilingual NLP.

I have authored multiple first-author papers published at venues including ACM Web Science, LREC-COLING (SIGUL), and CASE workshops. My work spans investigating politico-economic bias in language models, multimodal hate speech detection, and leveraging LLMs for social science applications. I also actively serve as a reviewer for ARR, EMNLP, ICLR, and related venues, having reviewed 100+ papers.

Before joining Koç University, I worked as an ML Engineer and Senior Software Engineer, building scalable systems and predictive models in industry. I hold two degrees from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) — an M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science.
