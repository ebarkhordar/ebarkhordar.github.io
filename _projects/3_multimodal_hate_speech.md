*   Designed a hybrid framework combining text encoders (BERT, LLaMA) with vision backbones (Swin Transformer, ViT) to detect subtle hate speech.
*   Improved robustness via focal loss, progressive unfreezing, and adversarial training.
*   Demonstrated superior performance on multimodal hate speech datasets, addressing explainability and ethical implications.
